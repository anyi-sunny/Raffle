# Raffle

This file takes in a csv file that consists of names in the second column and how many tickets they bought. The code then adds these names to a new list multiplying by the number of tickets they bought. With a list of names to choose from, the list is then shuffled and then the first five names in the list are printed out. 

This was written to select 5 raffle winners from a google sheets table linked to a google form made for Bowdoin Athletics' softball raflle.
